# Literature Review

Approaches or solutions that have been tried before on similar projects.

**Summary of Each Work**:

## Source 1: Examination of blood samples using deep learning and mobile microscopy

- **[Link](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04602-4)**
- **Objective**:
Image segmentation of microscopic images from blood samples
- **Methods**:
Mask_RCNN
- **Outcomes**:
"Thus, segmentation of all blood cell types and their classification was feasible with great accuracy: qualitatively evaluated, mean average precision of 0.57 and mean average recall of 0.61 are achieved for all blood cell types"
- **Relation to the Project**:
Quite similar objectives, very small dataset and broder target of all blood cells.

## Source 2: Blob Detection and Deep Learning for Leukemic Blood Image Analysis

- **[Link](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/1176)**
- **Objective**:
Diagnosis of leukemia, leukocyte detection
- **Methods**:
Special NN on the basis of ImageNet
- **Outcomes**:
Quite high accuracy, 1 out of 271 false negatives, small dataset
- **Relation to the Project**:
very similar basic idea, different NN approach
